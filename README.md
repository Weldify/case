# containers
`containers` is a collection of containers.
## Why?
I found myself writing convenience functions for containers in basically every single project of mine.
I'm also a big enjoyer of fully typed code, but in my opinion, luau's raw container types just *suck*
## Goals
+ Ease of use: All you should ever need is a cheat sheet
+ Simple implementation: The implementation must be simple and well-documented
+ Full typings: Containers must be fully typed with no compromises
+ Acceptable performance: The user shouldn't worry about performance
