# ktnr
`ktnr` is a collection of high level container implementations such as `List`, `Map` and `Set`.
## Why?
I got tired of writing convenience functions in each and every one of my projects. It just got repetitive.
I also find luau's raw container types ugly and unintuitive at times, especially dictionary types: `{[K]: }`
## Goals
+ Ease of use: All you should ever need is a cheat sheet
+ Simple implementation: The implementation must be simple and well-documented
+ Full typings: Containers must be fully typed with no compromises
+ Acceptable performance: The user shouldn't worry about performance

# STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
### The library is currently in heavy development. This means that it's barely usable and probably contains bugs and edge cases. Use at your own discretion or wait until the first release!
